```

### 5.2 State Management

**State File Location**: `~/.upkep_state`
**State Variables**:
- `UPDATE_LAST_RUN`: Timestamp of last update operations
- `CLEANUP_LAST_RUN`: Timestamp of last cleanup operations
- `SCRIPT_LAST_RUN`: Timestamp of last script execution

**Status Tracking**:
- `APT_STATUS`: "success", "failed", or "skipped"
- `SNAP_STATUS`: "success", "failed", or "skipped"
- `FLATPAK_STATUS`: "success", "failed", or "skipped"
- `CLEANUP_STATUS`: "success", "failed", or "skipped"

### 5.3 Module Interface

Each module must implement:
```bash
run_<module_name>() {
    # Module implementation
    # Update corresponding STATUS variable
    # Handle errors appropriately
}
```
