# Task ID: 7
# Title: Develop Dynamic Module Loader System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a dynamic module loader (module_loader.sh) to auto-discover and load modules from core and user directories at runtime.
# Details:
Implement module discovery using Bash globbing and source. Maintain an in-memory registry of loaded modules and metadata. Ensure backward compatibility with existing static modules. Support hot-reloading for development. Document module interface requirements.

# Test Strategy:
Test module discovery, loading, and registry population. Validate backward compatibility with legacy modules.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Module Discovery Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop logic to automatically discover available modules in a specified directory or configuration at runtime.
### Details:
Use mechanisms such as FileSystemWatcher (for .NET) or directory scanning (for Python/Node.js) to detect new or existing modules. Ensure the logic can handle both initial discovery and ongoing monitoring for new modules.

## 2. Load Modules Dynamically at Runtime [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Enable the system to load discovered modules into memory as needed during application execution.
### Details:
Implement dynamic loading using platform-specific APIs (e.g., Assembly.Load in .NET, importlib in Python, require in Node.js). Ensure proper error handling for failed loads and support for unloading if necessary.

## 3. Maintain In-Memory Registry [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.5
### Description: Create and manage an in-memory registry to track loaded modules and their metadata.
### Details:
Design a registry structure that allows efficient lookup, addition, and removal of modules. Store relevant metadata such as module name, version, and status.

## 4. Ensure Backward Compatibility [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.7
### Description: Implement mechanisms to ensure new module loader changes do not break compatibility with existing modules.
### Details:
Define and enforce a stable module interface or contract. Provide shims or adapters if necessary to support legacy modules.

## 5. Add Hot-Reloading Support [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.7
### Description: Enable modules to be reloaded at runtime without restarting the application.
### Details:
Monitor the module directory for changes and reload affected modules in place. Ensure state consistency and handle potential errors during reloads.

## 6. Document Module Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.3
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation for the expected module interface and integration guidelines.
### Details:
Describe required exports, initialization patterns, lifecycle hooks, and compatibility requirements. Include examples for both core and user modules.

## 7. Test Module Loader with Core and User Modules [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.5, 7.7, 7.3, 7.8, 7.9
### Description: Develop and execute tests to validate the module loader with both built-in and third-party modules.
### Details:
Write unit and integration tests covering discovery, loading, registry management, backward compatibility, and hot-reloading scenarios. Ensure robust error handling and edge case coverage.
