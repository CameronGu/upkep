# Task ID: 13
# Title: Optimize Performance and Resource Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 8, 9, 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement performance optimizations, parallel execution of independent modules, and resource monitoring/throttling.
# Details:
Use Bash job control (&, wait) for parallel execution where safe. Monitor resource usage with /proc and ps. Throttle operations if system load is high. Cache module metadata for faster loading. Profile execution time and memory usage. Document performance metrics.

# Test Strategy:
Benchmark full runs, measure resource usage, and validate parallel execution. Test throttling under load.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Parallel Execution [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and develop the system to support concurrent execution of tasks or processes, ensuring thread/process safety and minimizing contention.
### Details:
Select appropriate parallelization strategies and frameworks (e.g., thread pools, parallel loops). Ensure tasks are independent to avoid race conditions and shared state issues. Optimize the granularity of parallelism to balance overhead and performance.

## 2. Monitor Resource Usage [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Integrate monitoring tools to track CPU, memory, and I/O usage during parallel execution.
### Details:
Implement resource monitoring at both system and application levels. Collect metrics such as CPU utilization, memory consumption, and disk/network I/O. Ensure monitoring does not introduce significant overhead.

## 3. Add Throttling Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.5
### Description: Develop mechanisms to limit the number of concurrent tasks based on available resources and system thresholds.
### Details:
Use resource usage data to dynamically adjust the degree of parallelism. Implement logic to queue or delay tasks when resource limits are approached, preventing system overload.

## 4. Cache Module Metadata [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Implement a caching layer for frequently accessed module metadata to reduce redundant computation and improve performance.
### Details:
Design cache invalidation and consistency strategies. Choose appropriate cache storage (in-memory, distributed, etc.) and ensure thread-safe access in parallel environments.

## 5. Profile Execution Time and Memory [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Instrument the system to collect detailed timing and memory usage data for each parallel task.
### Details:
Use profiling tools or custom instrumentation to measure execution time and memory footprint. Aggregate and store profiling data for analysis.

## 6. Document Performance Metrics [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.5, 13.8
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation of all collected performance metrics, including resource usage, execution times, and cache hit rates.
### Details:
Summarize key findings, provide visualizations (charts, tables), and explain the impact of parallelism and caching on performance. Ensure documentation is accessible and up-to-date.

## 7. Test Under Load [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.7, 13.3, 13.8
### Description: Conduct load testing to evaluate system behavior and stability under high concurrency and resource utilization.
### Details:
Simulate realistic and peak workloads. Monitor for bottlenecks, failures, and performance degradation. Use results to refine throttling, caching, and parallel execution strategies.
