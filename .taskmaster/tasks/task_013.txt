# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Simple Sequential Execution
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 8, 9, 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement simple sequential execution of modules with basic resource monitoring, removing parallel execution complexity.
# Details:
Remove complex parallel execution, job control, and resource throttling. Use simple sequential execution which is more reliable and predictable for personal Linux maintenance. Add basic resource monitoring for informational purposes only. Remove complex caching and profiling - simple execution timing is sufficient.

# Test Strategy:
Test sequential execution of modules. Validate basic resource monitoring provides useful information without complexity.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Remove Parallel Execution Complexity [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Eliminate complex parallel execution in favor of simple, reliable sequential execution.
### Details:
Remove Bash job control, thread pools, and parallel execution logic. Sequential execution is simpler, more predictable, and sufficient for personal Linux maintenance tasks.

## 2. Add Basic Resource Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Integrate simple resource monitoring to display basic system information during execution.
### Details:
Add simple monitoring of CPU and memory usage for informational purposes. No complex thresholds or throttling - just basic visibility into system state.

## 3. Remove Complex Throttling Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.5
### Description: Eliminate complex resource-based throttling in favor of simple sequential execution.
### Details:
Remove complex load monitoring and throttling mechanisms. Sequential execution naturally prevents resource overload without complex management.

## 4. Remove Complex Caching [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Eliminate complex metadata caching in favor of simple module loading each time.
### Details:
Remove complex cache invalidation and consistency strategies. Simple module loading on each run is more reliable and easier to understand.

## 5. Add Simple Execution Timing [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Implement basic timing information for each module execution.
### Details:
Add simple start/end time tracking for each module. Display execution time in user-friendly format. No complex profiling or memory analysis needed.

## 6. Remove Complex Performance Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.5, 13.8
### Description: Eliminate complex performance metrics documentation in favor of simple execution summaries.
### Details:
Remove complex performance analysis and visualization. Simple execution summaries (time taken, success/failure) are sufficient for personal use.

## 7. Test Simple Sequential Execution [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.7, 13.3, 13.8
### Description: Test the simplified sequential execution approach under normal conditions.
### Details:
Test that modules execute in order, timing information is accurate, and basic resource monitoring provides useful feedback without overwhelming the user.
