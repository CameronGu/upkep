# Task ID: 11
# Title: Enable Modular Architecture and User Module Support
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Support dynamic loading, validation, and sharing of user-created modules with a simple interface and optional sharing mechanisms.
# Details:
Document module interface (run_<module_name>()). Implement module validation (structure, permissions). Provide guided module creation tool (dialog/whiptail). Support sharing via GitHub Gist (curl API). Add basic security scanning for shared modules (shellcheck, regex checks).

# Test Strategy:
Test user module loading, validation, and sharing. Validate security scanning and guided creation flow.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Document Module Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define and document the expected structure, required methods, and properties for modules to ensure consistency and interoperability.
### Details:
Specify interface requirements such as initializer/finalizer functions, public/private members, and usage guidelines.

## 2. Implement Module Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Develop logic to validate that modules conform to the documented interface and structural requirements.
### Details:
Create validation routines that check for required functions, properties, and correct initialization/finalization patterns.

## 3. Add Guided Module Creation Tool [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.5
### Description: Build a user-facing tool that assists users in creating new modules following the documented interface and validation rules.
### Details:
Provide step-by-step guidance, templates, and real-time validation feedback during module creation.

## 4. Support Module Sharing via GitHub Gist [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.5, 11.7
### Description: Enable users to share modules by exporting and importing them through GitHub Gist integration.
### Details:
Implement authentication, gist creation, and retrieval workflows for seamless sharing and loading of modules.

## 5. Integrate Security Scanning [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.5, 11.3
### Description: Incorporate automated security scanning to detect vulnerabilities or malicious code in user modules before loading or sharing.
### Details:
Leverage static analysis tools or third-party APIs to scan module code and report issues to users.

## 6. Test User Module Loading [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.5, 11.8
### Description: Develop and execute tests to ensure modules can be dynamically loaded, validated, and initialized correctly in the application.
### Details:
Test various scenarios including valid, invalid, and malicious modules to verify robustness and security.

## 7. Validate Sharing and Creation Flows [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.7, 11.3, 11.8, 11.9
### Description: Perform end-to-end testing of module creation and sharing workflows to ensure usability, correctness, and security.
### Details:
Simulate user journeys from module creation to sharing and loading, verifying all validation and security checks are enforced.
