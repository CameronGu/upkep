# Task ID: 11
# Title: Enable Simple User Module Support
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Support basic loading and creation of user-created modules with simple interface and basic templates.
# Details:
Document simple module interface (run_<module_name>()). Implement basic module validation (file exists, has required function). Provide simple module creation templates. Remove complex sharing mechanisms and security scanning - keep user modules local and simple.

# Test Strategy:
Test user module loading and validation. Validate simple creation templates work correctly.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Document Simple Module Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define and document the basic structure and required function for modules to ensure consistency.
### Details:
Specify simple interface requirements: .sh file in modules/user/, run_<module_name>() function, basic error handling. Keep examples simple and focused.

## 2. Implement Basic Module Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Develop simple logic to validate that modules have required function and basic structure.
### Details:
Create basic validation: file exists, is readable, contains run_<module_name>() function. No complex structural analysis needed.

## 3. Provide Simple Module Templates [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.5
### Description: Create basic templates that help users create new modules following the simple interface.
### Details:
Provide simple template files showing basic module structure. No complex guided creation tool - simple copy-and-modify approach.

## 4. Remove Complex Sharing Features [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.5, 11.7
### Description: Eliminate GitHub Gist integration and complex sharing mechanisms in favor of simple local modules.
### Details:
Remove complex sharing infrastructure. Users can share modules manually if needed. Focus on local module creation and usage.

## 5. Remove Security Scanning Complexity [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.5, 11.3
### Description: Eliminate automated security scanning in favor of simple user responsibility for their own modules.
### Details:
Remove complex security scanning infrastructure. Users are responsible for their own modules. Keep system simple and focused on core functionality.

## 6. Test Simple User Module Loading [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.5, 11.8
### Description: Develop and execute tests to ensure modules can be loaded and validated correctly.
### Details:
Test basic scenarios: valid modules load and execute, invalid modules are rejected with clear messages. Keep tests simple and focused.

## 7. Validate Simple Creation Flow [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.7, 11.3, 11.8, 11.9
### Description: Test that the simplified module creation process works correctly for typical users.
### Details:
Test end-to-end flow: copy template, modify for specific need, place in modules/user/, verify it loads and runs correctly.
