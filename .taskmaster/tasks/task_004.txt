# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Comprehensive Logging System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop structured logging to ~/.upkep/logs/upkep.log and per-module logs, with log rotation and multiple log levels.
# Details:
Use Bash functions for logging with levels (INFO, WARN, ERROR, AUDIT). Implement log rotation using logrotate or custom Bash logic. Include timestamps and operation results. Ensure logs are not world-readable. Support audit logging for compliance.

# Test Strategy:
Test log creation, rotation, and level filtering. Validate log content and permissions.
