# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Comprehensive Logging System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enhance the existing log_message function to optionally write to a simple log file when users need persistent logging for troubleshooting.
# Details:
Enhance the existing log_message function in scripts/core/utils.sh to provide optional file logging for user troubleshooting. The primary interface remains console output (unchanged), with an opt-in file logging capability controlled via environment variable. Focus on simplicity and user experience rather than enterprise features, ensuring backward compatibility while providing useful debugging capabilities.

# Test Strategy:
Test both console and file logging functionality. Verify environment variable control works correctly. Ensure backward compatibility with existing behavior. Test log level filtering based on configuration.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Basic Logging Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement basic logging function in scripts/core/utils.sh and create log directory structure.
### Details:


## 2. Module Logging Integration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate logging functions with module templates and ensure per-module log files exist.

Since we're moving to a single log file approach (~/.upkep/upkep.log), update module templates to use the enhanced log_message function instead of creating separate per-module log files. This maintains simplicity while ensuring all modules can benefit from the optional file logging capability.

The module templates should be modified to:
1. Remove any code related to creating or managing per-module log files
2. Use the centralized log_message function for all logging needs
3. Pass appropriate log levels to ensure proper filtering
4. Include module name in log messages for better traceability

This change aligns with our goal of keeping the logging system simple while still providing useful debugging capabilities.

## 3. Implement Optional File Logging [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Enhance log_message() function to optionally write to ~/.upkep/upkep.log when UPKEP_LOG_TO_FILE=true is set.
### Details:
Modify the existing log_message function to check for the UPKEP_LOG_TO_FILE environment variable. When set to 'true', append log messages to a single file at ~/.upkep/upkep.log while maintaining the current console output behavior. Ensure the log directory exists before writing.

## 4. Implement Basic Log Level Filtering [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add simple log level support (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR) with filtering based on configuration.
### Details:
Extend log_message function to accept a log level parameter. Implement a simple configuration option to control which log levels are displayed/written. Default to showing all levels except DEBUG unless explicitly enabled.

## 5. Add Timestamp and Context Information [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Include timestamp, log level, and context information in log messages for better troubleshooting.
### Details:
Format log messages with timestamp, log level, and optional context information (module name, function, etc.) to help users understand when and where events occurred during execution.

## 6. Document Logging Usage [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add documentation for users on how to enable file logging for troubleshooting.
### Details:
Update user documentation to explain how to enable file logging with UPKEP_LOG_TO_FILE=true and how to use the log file for troubleshooting. Include examples of common debugging workflows.

## 7. Ensure Backward Compatibility [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Verify that all existing code using log_message continues to work without modification.
### Details:
Test all existing code that uses log_message to ensure the enhancements don't break current functionality. Maintain backward compatibility with existing call patterns.
