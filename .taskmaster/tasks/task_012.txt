# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Basic Error Handling
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8, 9, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Add simple error handling with clear success/fail/skip messages and basic retry for transient errors.
# Details:
Standardize simple error reporting across modules (success/fail/skip with clear messages). Implement basic retries for transient errors (simple retry count, no exponential backoff complexity). Remove complex rollback and diagnostics - focus on clear error messages and reliable operation.

# Test Strategy:
Test error scenarios and verify clear messaging. Check basic retry functionality works correctly.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Standardize Simple Error Reporting [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define and implement a simple, consistent format for success/fail/skip messages across the system.
### Details:
Establish simple message formats: SUCCESS, FAILED, SKIPPED with clear descriptions. No complex error codes or logging conventions needed.

## 2. Implement Basic Retry Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Develop simple retry mechanisms for failed operations using basic retry counts.
### Details:
Add simple retry logic: retry failed operations up to 3 times with 5-second delays. No exponential backoff complexity needed for personal Linux maintenance.

## 3. Remove Complex Rollback Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.5
### Description: Eliminate complex rollback procedures in favor of simple error reporting and user decision-making.
### Details:
Remove complex transactional rollback logic. For personal Linux maintenance, clear error messages and user control are more appropriate than automatic rollback.

## 4. Simplify Diagnostics and Error Classification [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Provide basic error information without complex classification or diagnostics.
### Details:
Capture basic error information: what failed, simple reason why. No complex stack traces, metadata, or error categorization needed.

## 5. Remove State Recovery Complexity [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.7, 12.3
### Description: Eliminate complex state management and recovery in favor of simple operation status tracking.
### Details:
Remove complex state recovery mechanisms. Simple status tracking (last run time, success/failure) is sufficient for personal maintenance tasks.

## 6. Test Basic Error Scenarios [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.8
### Description: Develop and execute tests to validate simple error handling behavior.
### Details:
Create focused tests covering common failure scenarios, retry behavior, and clear error messaging. Keep tests simple and practical.

## 7. Remove Complex Rollback Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Eliminate complex rollback testing in favor of simple error message validation.
### Details:
Remove complex rollback test scenarios. Focus on testing that error messages are clear and operations fail gracefully.

## 8. Document Simple Error Handling Patterns [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create basic documentation outlining simple error handling approach and patterns.
### Details:
Document simple error handling: success/fail/skip messages, basic retry logic, clear error reporting. Keep documentation focused and practical.
