# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Robust Error Handling and Recovery
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8, 9, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Add comprehensive error handling, retry mechanisms, rollback, and diagnostics for all operations and modules.
# Details:
Standardize error reporting across modules. Implement automatic retries for transient errors (with exponential backoff). Add rollback logic for failed operations (where feasible). Provide detailed diagnostics and error classification. Support state recovery from errors.

# Test Strategy:
Simulate failures and verify error handling, retries, and rollback. Check diagnostic output and state recovery.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Standardize Error Reporting [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define and implement a consistent format for error messages and logs across the system.
### Details:
Establish error codes, message structures, and logging conventions to ensure all errors are reported in a uniform and descriptive manner.

## 2. Implement Retry Logic with Backoff [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Develop mechanisms to automatically retry failed operations using exponential backoff strategies.
### Details:
Integrate retry logic into critical workflows, ensuring retries are logged and respect system limits to avoid cascading failures.

## 3. Add Rollback Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.5
### Description: Introduce rollback procedures to revert system state in case of unrecoverable errors.
### Details:
Design and implement transactional or compensating actions to restore previous state when operations fail after partial completion.

## 4. Provide Diagnostics and Error Classification [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Enhance error handling with detailed diagnostics and categorize errors for easier troubleshooting.
### Details:
Capture stack traces, context, and metadata for each error; classify errors by type, severity, and recoverability.

## 5. Integrate with State Recovery [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.7, 12.3
### Description: Ensure error handling mechanisms interact correctly with state management and recovery processes.
### Details:
Coordinate rollback and retry logic with state recovery modules to maintain data consistency and system reliability.

## 6. Test Error Scenarios [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.8
### Description: Develop and execute tests to simulate various error conditions and validate error handling behavior.
### Details:
Create unit, integration, and end-to-end tests covering common and edge-case failures, including retries and rollbacks.

## 7. Validate Rollback [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Verify that rollback mechanisms correctly restore system state after failures.
### Details:
Test rollback logic under different failure scenarios to ensure no residual side effects or data inconsistencies remain.

## 8. Document Error Handling Patterns [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation outlining error handling strategies, patterns, and usage guidelines.
### Details:
Detail standardized error reporting, retry and rollback logic, diagnostics, and integration points for future maintainability.
