# Task ID: 14
# Title: Develop Test Suite and Continuous Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8, 9, 6, 12
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a comprehensive test suite (unit, integration, visual) and set up CI for automated testing and code quality checks.
# Details:
Use Bats (Bash Automated Testing System, latest version) for unit/integration tests. Add visual output checks (compare snapshots). Integrate shellcheck and shfmt for linting/formatting. Set up GitHub Actions or GitLab CI for automated runs. Mock system commands for safe testing.

# Test Strategy:
Run all tests in CI. Validate coverage, linting, and visual output. Ensure tests pass on multiple Linux distros.
