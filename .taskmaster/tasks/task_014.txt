# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8, 9, 6, 12
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a comprehensive test suite using existing test patterns in tests/test_cases/ with focus on reliability and maintainability.
# Details:
Follow existing test patterns in tests/test_cases/ directory. Use consistent test structure and naming. Focus on unit and integration tests for core functionality. Add basic visual output validation. Integrate shellcheck for code quality. Set up simple CI for automated testing. Mock system commands for safe testing following existing mock patterns.
