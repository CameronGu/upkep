# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement State Management and Persistence
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop state management (state.sh) to track last run timestamps, execution metrics, and support state validation and recovery.
# Details:
Store state in ~/.upkep/state.json using jq for JSON manipulation (latest stable version). Implement atomic writes and backup/restore for state file. Add validation and recovery logic for corrupted state. Track per-module and per-operation metrics.

# Test Strategy:
Test state read/write, validation, and recovery from corrupted files. Simulate concurrent access and verify atomicity.
