The solution maintains upkep's philosophy of minimal dependencies while providing advanced functionality.\n\nAll 14 enhanced YAML parsing tests are passing, covering simple keys, nested keys, multi-level nesting, edge cases, empty values, special characters, module configurations, and environment overrides.
