The solution maintains upkep's philosophy of minimal dependencies while providing advanced functionality.\n\nAll 14 enhanced YAML parsing tests are passing, covering simple keys, nested keys, multi-level nesting, edge cases, empty values, special characters, module configurations, and environment overrides.

Update main.sh to source cli.sh\n2. Route main.sh arguments through cli.sh's parse_args()\n3. Maintain backward compatibility for existing flags\n4. Map existing functionality to appropriate subcommands\n\n# Implementation Strategy\n- Keep existing main() function as the default \"run\" behavior\n- Add CLI routing that defaults to \"run\" when no subcommand is given\n- Preserve all existing flags and functionality\n</info added on 2025-07-23T05:47:56.741Z>\n<info added on 2025-07-23T05:51:05.484Z>\n# Implementation Completed\n\n## Changes Made\n- Added `source \"$BASE_DIR/core/cli.sh\"` to main.sh\n- Created `is_subcommand()` function to detect new vs legacy CLI usage\n- Implemented CLI routing logic in the entry point\n- Preserved all legacy functions for backward compatibility\n- Fixed `show_state` → `show_current_status` in cli.sh\n\n## Testing Results\n- `./scripts/main.sh help` - Works (new subcommand format)\n- `./scripts/main.sh --help` - Works (legacy format, same output)\n- `./scripts/main.sh status` - Works (new subcommand format)\n- `./scripts/main.sh --status` - Works (legacy format with ASCII art)\n\n## Key Features\n- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing flags (--help, --version, --config, --status, etc.) work exactly as before\n- **New Subcommands**: Modern CLI with subcommands (run, status, config, list-modules, etc.)\n- **Intelligent Routing**: Automatically detects whether user is using new or legacy format\n- **Default Behavior**: No arguments still runs normal maintenance (preserves existing behavior)\n\n## Architecture\n- Legacy processing preserved for existing users\n- New CLI framework available for modern usage\n- Both approaches coexist seamlessly\n</info added on 2025-07-23T05:51:05.484Z>",

Enhanced YAML parsing (via yq) still used throughout the codebase\n2. `scripts/upkep.sh` depends on yq for JSON export functionality\n3. Multiple tests still source the old `global.sh`\n4. No migration path implemented for existing configurations\n\n**CURRENT SYSTEM STATE:**\n- Removed tests for functionality that's still active in production code\n- Partial migration creates system inconsistency (91% code reduction claimed is inaccurate)\n- High risk of breaking functionality that depends on enhanced YAML parsing\n\n**REQUIRED ACTIONS FOR SUBTASK 18.5:**\n1. Either complete full migration by removing ALL old configuration files\n2. OR restore enhanced YAML tests until migration is complete\n3. Create proper migration path for existing user configurations\n4.
