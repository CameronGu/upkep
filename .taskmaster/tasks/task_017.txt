# Task ID: 17
# Title: Fix Remaining Linting Issues
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 16
# Priority: high
# Description: Address all remaining linting issues identified by the enhanced linter, including line count violations, shebang violations, permission warnings, and ShellCheck issues.
# Details:
This task involves systematically addressing all remaining linting issues identified by the enhanced linter:

1. **Refactor Large Core Files**:
   - Break down large core files (cli.sh, prompt_generator.sh, state.sh, utils.sh) that exceed 300 lines of code
   - Extract logical groups of functions into separate module files
   - Ensure proper imports and dependencies between the new modules
   - Maintain backward compatibility with existing function calls
   - Example refactoring approach for utils.sh:
     ```bash
     # Original utils.sh (400+ lines)
     # Split into:
     # - utils_logging.sh (logging functions)
     # - utils_filesystem.sh (file operations)
     # - utils_validation.sh (input validation)
     # - utils.sh (core utilities, imports the above)
     ```

2. **Add Shebangs to Empty Mock Files**:
   - Identify all empty mock files used for testing
   - Add proper shebang lines to each file: `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
   - Ensure consistency across all mock files

3. **Fix File Permissions**:
   - Set executable files (scripts, test runners) to 755 permissions
   - Set non-executable files (configs, data files) to 644 permissions
   - Use `find` and `chmod` to apply permissions systematically:
     ```bash
     # For executable files
     find ./scripts -type f -name "*.sh" -exec chmod 755 {} \;
     # For non-executable files
     find ./config -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
     ```

4. **Address Remaining ShellCheck Issues**:
   - Run ShellCheck with `--enable=all` to identify all potential issues
   - Fix any remaining warnings or errors
   - Document any intentional ShellCheck suppressions with clear comments

5. **Update Linting Documentation**:
   - Document the refactoring changes in the project's development guide
   - Update any module dependency diagrams to reflect the new structure
   - Add comments to explain complex sections of refactored code

# Test Strategy:
1. **Automated Verification**:
   - Run the linting system against the entire codebase after each fix
   - Verify that the number of linting issues decreases after each change
   - Final run should show zero linting issues
   - Execute: `./scripts/lint.sh --verbose`

2. **Refactoring Tests**:
   - For each refactored file, run the existing test suite to ensure functionality is preserved
   - Create new unit tests for any newly extracted modules
   - Verify that all functions remain accessible through their original paths
   - Test command: `./tests/run_all_tests.sh`

3. **Permission Verification**:
   - Use a script to verify all file permissions match the expected patterns:
     ```bash
     find ./scripts -type f -name "*.sh" -not -perm 755 | wc -l  # Should be 0
     find ./config -type f -not -perm 644 | wc -l  # Should be 0
     ```

4. **ShellCheck Validation**:
   - Run ShellCheck with strict settings on all shell scripts
   - Verify zero warnings/errors or only documented suppressions
   - Command: `shellcheck --enable=all --shell=bash scripts/**/*.sh`

5. **Manual Review**:
   - Conduct a code review of all refactored files
   - Ensure logical separation of concerns in the new module structure
   - Verify that documentation accurately reflects the new organization
