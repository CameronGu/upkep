# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Core CLI Interface with Subcommands
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the main CLI entry point (main.sh) supporting subcommands (run, status, config) and options.
# Details:
Use Bash 5.1+ for scripting. Implement CLI parsing with getopts or a modern Bash CLI helper (e.g., argbash or shflags). Ensure support for interactive and non-interactive modes. Provide comprehensive help output and error handling for unknown commands.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test CLI parsing for all subcommands and options. Validate help output and error handling for invalid input.
