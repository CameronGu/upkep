echo "1. Problem: Content contains attribute names:"

echo "Solution 1: Use explicit parameter names"
echo "   create_quick_box --title='Title' --content='Content' --style='info' --width=50"

echo "Solution 2: Use JSON-like structure"
echo "   create_quick_box '{\"title\": \"Title\", \"content\": \"Content\", \"style\": \"info\"}'"
echo

echo "Solution 3: Use HTML-like attributes with explicit syntax"
echo "   create_quick_box '<box style=\"info\" width=\"50\">Content</box>'"

echo "Solution 4: Use escape sequences for literal text"
